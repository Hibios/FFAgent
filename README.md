## 🧩 What is SMUX?

**SMUX** is a specialized structural syntax designed by FFAgent to define UI architecture without the ambiguity of natural language. It describes layout, logic, and component placement in a machine-readable format.

**Example SMUX input:**
```xml
<flex>
    dir:column
    justify:start
    align:stretch
    width:1440
    height:900
    <flex>
        dir:row
        justify:between
        padding:10
        height:50
        <widget>
            type:Button
            content:"File"
            notes:"Project management dropdown"
        </widget>
    </flex>
</flex>
